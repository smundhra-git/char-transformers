C++ is a high-performance general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language.
It is an object-oriented language that supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
C++ provides low-level memory manipulation features which make it ideal for system programming, game engines, and high-performance applications.
The Standard Template Library (STL) provides a set of common classes for vectors, lists, queues, and stacks.
C++11 introduced modern features like auto keyword, lambda expressions, smart pointers, and move semantics.
RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) is a common idiom in C++ used for resource management.
Templates allow generic programming, enabling functions and classes to operate with generic types.
The const keyword is used to define constants and to prevent modification of variables or member functions.
References in C++ provide an alias for another variable and are safer than pointers.
Smart pointers like unique_ptr and shared_ptr help manage memory automatically and prevent memory leaks.
Virtual functions allow derived classes to override methods in a base class, enabling runtime polymorphism.
The volatile keyword tells the compiler that a variable's value may change at any time without any action being taken by the code the compiler finds nearby.
Exception handling in C++ is done using try, catch, and throw blocks.
Namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups and to prevent name collisions.
The preprocessor handles directives like #include and #define before the actual compilation begins.
Inline functions are a suggestion to the compiler to substitute the code of the function into its caller.
Friend functions can access private and protected members of a class.
Operator overloading allows redefining the way operators work for user-defined types.
Move semantics and rvalue references allow efficient transfer of resources instead of copying.
C++20 introduced concepts, modules, coroutines, and ranges to further modernize the language.
Memory management in C++ is manual, but modern C++ encourages the use of RAII and smart pointers.
Undefined behavior is a common issue in C++ when code violates language rules, leading to unpredictable results.
The compilation process involves preprocessing, compilation, assembly, and linking.
Header files typically contain declarations, while source files contain definitions.
Static members belong to the class rather than any specific object instance.
Constexpr specifies that the value of a variable or function can be computed at compile time.
Lambda expressions provide a concise way to define anonymous function objects.
The auto type specifier instructs the compiler to deduce the type of a variable from its initializer.
Iterators are objects that point to an element in a container and can be used to traverse through elements.
Multithreading support was standardized in C++11 with the thread library.
Atomic operations allow lock-free concurrent programming.
Mutexes and condition variables are synchronization primitives used in multithreaded programming.
C++ supports multiple inheritance, allowing a class to inherit from more than one base class.
The diamond problem in multiple inheritance is solved using virtual inheritance.
Cast operators like static_cast, dynamic_cast, const_cast, and reinterpret_cast provide type conversions.
The rule of three, rule of five, and rule of zero are guidelines for managing resources in classes.
SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error) is a technique used in template metaprogramming.
Variadic templates allow templates to accept an arbitrary number of arguments.
Type traits allow querying and modifying properties of types at compile time.
The std::vector is a dynamic array that can resize itself automatically when an element is inserted or deleted.
std::map is a sorted associative container that contains key-value pairs with unique keys.
std::unordered_map is a hash table based container that stores elements formed by the combination of a key value and a mapped value.
The standard library algorithms include functions for sorting, searching, counting, and manipulating ranges of elements.
C++ is widely used in finance for high-frequency trading due to its low latency.
Game development relies heavily on C++ for performance-critical rendering and physics engines.
Embedded systems often use C++ for its ability to interface with hardware and limited resources.
Operating systems like Windows and parts of Linux are written in C and C++.
Browsers like Chrome and Firefox use C++ for their rendering engines.
Machine learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch have C++ backends for performance.
Database systems like MySQL and MongoDB are implemented in C++.
