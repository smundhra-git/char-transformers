i will be documenting my work. Let's see how far i get. 

first what i am working on - 
I read this paper : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762 and now I am feeling like a good developer so I plan to write an entire transformer model, lets see how this macho'sm plays out.


Also I am talking to GPT on the side to breakdown the ideas i have in my head to actionable tasks (secret sauce - it works)

Okay coming back to what I am doing exactly -
I am gonna use text, possibly Shakespeare or my own code or any other text and make it predict the next character 

Let's start from 1st phase -
I will input a long stream of data (text) and then map each character to a number since our model will be using that. 

e.g. could be 'a' will be 1 and 'b' 2 and so on, and then 'A' could be 27 ...

As a weird guy, I am not using cursor right now

data/raw.txt will have the data
now i will make the Matrix, yes i am not using Eigen - keeping it as lightweight as possible and i like speed so we use C++.

In math/Matrix we will build a type matrix with dimensions

We will implement a constructor, indexing i, j = like vectors
basic sanity checks and a matmul function 

This is very basic - i have written the constructor, an access element at (row, col)
i am deciding if i want to have a conveience operator like () to call a position - i am gonna avoid it for right now. may come back later

 i have written the header file for matrix - after implementing the function i will write a Cmakefile and then eat food - feeling mexican

I am finished implementing the matrix functions and like any good developer i would test it now - you know where? In main.cpp

for cpmpilation use - g++ -std=c++17 -I./src -o main src/main.cpp src/math/matrix.cpp


I am happy to see this - 
" ./main 
=== Matrix tests start ===
Constructor / zeros / constant / fill tests passed.
add / subtract / hadamard / scalar_mul tests passed.
matmul test passed.
transpose test passed.
row_softmax tests passed.
Example matrix A:
1 2 3 
4 5 6 
=== All Matrix tests passed successfully ===
"

next we will move to phase 2 an autograd engine (Tensor + Graph) - after this our matrix will keep a track of operations and compute gradients
