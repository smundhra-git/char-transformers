# N-Dimensional Transformer from Scratch in C++

If you are here purely to learn, after reading the Readme, you should definetely read document.txt - it talks about hows, whats and whys which is crucial and contains links to some amazing papers, articles and youtube videos I will definietely recommend.

A lightweight, dependency-free implementation of a Transformer model (based on "Attention Is All You Need") written entirely in C++.

I have not used any external libraries like Eigen or BLAS to write this (though using them may have made this project quicker). Getting on how to run it simple -

Ensure you have `cmake` and a C++17 compatible compiler, then run this commands

```bash
cmake .
make
./main
```

Feel free to contribute and optimize this as much as possible.
